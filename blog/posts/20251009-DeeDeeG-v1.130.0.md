## Pulsar v1.130.0: Spooktacular Edition

Welcome to another Spooktacular Pulsar release!

To welcome in the Autumn, we'd like to shout out some updates to our website!

The long awaited revamp of our web presence not only massively improves and updates our documentation, it also unifies our web design. There are new subdomains for each service, and we've put our hugely improved documentation live (which you may have seen during its beta period). It's now more in-depth and updated, and it's finally got auto-updating API docs for Pulsar, which we have been missing since the beginning.

As for the Pulsar editor itself, we've got some updated Tree-sitter and language support, as well as autocomplete-css and autocomplete-plus updates and improvements, a focus fix for tree-view on Windows, a fix so that find-in-project searches properly exclude open-and-modified files that don't match the given path filter, and a change to `snippets` to restore legacy compatibility with the `emmet` package.

A new "I18n" API (short for "internationalization") allows Pulsar and even community packages to localize all their text to a user's preferred language. It's in its very early stages, but after some more time and work you should be able to set your preferred language and have Pulsar respect it.

As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
\- The Pulsar Team

## 1.130.0

- `autocomplete-plus` can now make other text edits to the buffer when a suggestion is accepted - for instance, adding an `import` for that suggestion.
- Experimental localization support is now being added into the editor, allowing the editor, core packages and even community packages to localize their interface for any language.
- `autocomplete-css` has gotten significantly updated completions.
- Various documentation and UI links updated after website update.
- Changed some returns in a backwards compatible way to ensure the community package `emmet` will work again.
